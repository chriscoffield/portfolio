									<h1>More Words<br />
									ABOUT ME</h1>
									<p>23-year-old eager to break into the world of software development. Self-taught and constantly learning to improve but how did I get here?</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_2395.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Coming out of high school, I did not have an idea of what career interested me. The path of drafting and design seemed like a career that could sustain me and teach me how to develop an eye for constructing different ideas. I chose the Architectural Engineering Technology field with a desire to design buildings that customers would love. As I went through my career, I found that I had a love for computers and the design of websites and applications. I also realized how much there is was to learn but, also, so many ways tasks can be accomplished. As I started to dive into the world of simple HTML and CSS, my eyes were opened to a whole new world. Javascript and Python showed me how hard I'd have to work, but I grew to love what I was learning. There was so much I could do in this field so I decided to teach myself all I could on the side and I am still learning to this day.</p>
								<p>Aside from time spent improving and working to land a job, I have a couple of hobbies. Playing the guitar brings me peace and sports have always been my number one hobby. I like to relax and catch up on sleep when I can. Aside from this, I am just working to improve. Thank you for yur time and thank you for reading! &#9786; </p>
